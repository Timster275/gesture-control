# gesture-controll
This will be a project that implements gesture controll for your mac/pc using python 

Using google mediapipe we can track different points on a hand, using them to evaluate if the user is showing a gesture.
Furthermore we can use their popular Face-mesh functionality do determine mimic inputs that could possibly lead to an action too.
